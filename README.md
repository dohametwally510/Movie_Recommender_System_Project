*****************************************************
this project consists of two files 

 1) project_code_recommender.ipynb
*********************************
after the preprocessing of this data the code show the implementation of three different recommendation algorithms: k-nearest neighbors (KNN), factorization machines (FM), and neural collaborative filtering (NCF) and example for the result of every algorithm

2) recommender_dashboard.ipynb
***********************************
introduces a Dash app for building a user interface to interact with the recommendation system. Here's a summary of the code:

get_top_n Function: This function takes the predictions generated by the FM model and returns the top-N recommendations for each user. It uses a defaultdict to store the recommendations for each user, sorts them based on estimated ratings, and returns the top-N recommendations.

Updated recommender_fm Function: The recommender_fm function is modified to generate recommendations for a specific user. It builds an anti-test set using the build_anti_testset method and applies the FM model to make predictions. It then calls the get_top_n function to get the top-N recommendations for the user and formats the results as a DataFrame.

Updated recommender_knn Function: The recommender_knn function is modified to generate similar items for a given item. It finds the index of the selected movie in the movies DataFrame, uses the KNN model to find similar items, and returns a DataFrame with the similar items excluding the selected item.

Dash App Initialization: The Dash app is initialized using dash.Dash with a name and Bootstrap external stylesheets.

Color Definitions: The colors dictionary is defined to specify the background and text colors for the app.

User Page Layout: The layout for the User Page is defined using Dash components. It includes a dropdown to select a user, an input to set the number of recommendations, and two Div elements to display the user's history and recommended movies.

Item Page Layout: The layout for the Item Page is defined similarly to the User Page. It includes a dropdown to select an item, two Div elements to display the item's details and similar items, and a Graph component to show the rating distribution for the selected item.

Callbacks: Two callbacks are defined to handle the dynamic content updates in the app. The update_user_page callback is triggered when the user dropdown or number of items input changes, and it updates the user's history and recommendations. The update_item_page callback is triggered when the item dropdown changes, and it updates the item's profile, similar items, and rating distribution.

Main App Layout: The main app layout is defined, which includes a Tabs component with two tabs: User Page and Item Page.

App Execution: The app is run using app.run_server, with the debug argument set to False.
